# Spotify Clone

A Spotify clone built in Next.js using Spotify API to return data including playlists, liked songs, and more from the user's existing account. Playback behavior is made possible through the use of custom hooks. User authentication is achieved with next-auth and middleware.

Future functionality includes search, favorites, and skipping songs.

**Due to limitations of the Spotify API, you must be logged into the Spotify app on desktop or mobile and have it open in order to use this clone.**
